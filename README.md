# BlackJack
This is a Blackjack that I made with again my Python Zero to Hero Course on Udemy however I don't actually know how to play Blackjack very well and I don't know the rules or 
how any of the bidding works so I kinda didn't really do well on this project... In addition to that I'm very new to OOP and this project was to practice that... So IDK if i 
feel like it I may come back to this project in the future when I have motivation to A: learn blackjack and B: to fix my code...
we'll see
SORRY NINJ_
